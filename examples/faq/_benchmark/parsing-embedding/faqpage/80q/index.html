The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html'>coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What do funeral home workers need to know about handling decedents who had COVID-19?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "A funeral or visitation service can be held for a person who has died of COVID-19. Funeral home workers should follow their routine infection prevention and control precautions when handling a decedent who died of COVID-19. If it is necessary to transfer a body to a bag, follow <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/standard-precautions.html'>Standard Precautions</a>, including additional personal protective equipment (PPE) if splashing of fluids is expected. For transporting a body after the body has been bagged, disinfect the outside of the bag with a <a class='tp-link-policy noDecoration' href='https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2' target='new' rel='noopener noreferrer'>product with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon</a> expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time, etc.). Wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling the body bag.</p> <p>Embalming can be conducted. During embalming, follow Standard Precautions including the use of additional PPE if splashing is expected (e.g. disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N95 respirator). Wear appropriate respiratory protection if any procedures will generate aerosols or if required for chemicals used in accordance with the manufacturer’s label. Wear heavy-duty gloves over nitrile disposable gloves if there is a risk of cuts, puncture wounds, or other injuries that break the skin. Additional information on how to safely conduct aerosol-generating procedures is in the <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-postmortem-specimens.html#autopsy'>CDC’s Postmortem Guidance</a>. Cleaning should be conducted in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. <a class='tp-link-policy' href='https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2' target='new' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Products with EPA-approved emerging viral pathogens claimspdf iconexternal icon</a> are expected to be effective against COVID-19 based on data for harder to kill viruses. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products (e.g., concentration, application method and contact time).</p> <p>After cleaning and removal of PPE, perform <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html'>hand hygiene</a> by washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water is not available. Soap and water should be used if the hands are visibly soiled.</p> <p>Decedents with COVID-19 can be buried or cremated, but check for any additional state and local requirements that may dictate the handling and disposition of the remains of individuals who have died of certain infectious diseases."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Should outdoor playgrounds, like those at schools or in parks, be cleaned and disinfected to prevent COVID-19?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Outdoor areas generally require normal routine cleaning and do not require disinfection. Spraying disinfectant on outdoor playgrounds is not an efficient use of disinfectant supplies and has not been proven to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the public. You should maintain existing cleaning and hygiene practices for outdoor areas. If practical, high touch surfaces made of plastic or metal, such as grab bars and railings, should be cleaned routinely. Cleaning and disinfection of wooden surfaces (e.g., play structures, benches, tables) or groundcovers (e.g., mulch, sand) is not recommended."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "How effective are alternative disinfection methods, such as ultrasonic waves, high intensity UV radiation, and LED blue light?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "The efficacy of these disinfection methods against the virus that causes COVID-19 is not known. EPA only recommends use of the<a href='https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2'> surface disinfectants identified on List N</a> against the virus that causes COVID-19. EPA does not routinely review the safety or efficacy of pesticidal devices, such as UV lights, LED lights, or ultrasonic devices. Therefore, EPA cannot confirm whether, or under what circumstances, such products might be effective against the spread of COVID-19."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "How long do companies need to close for disinfection after an exposure? How long before other workers can come back to work?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Companies do not necessarily need to close after a person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 has been in a company facility. The area(s) used or visited by the ill person should be closed for 24 hours or as long as possible. Open outside doors and windows as much as possible ensuring that doing so does not pose a safety risk to children using the facility (i.e. make sure that children are not able to enter the closed off area through any windows or doors). and use ventilating fans to increase air circulation in the area. Once the area has been <a href='/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html'>appropriately disinfected</a>, it can be opened for use. Workers without close contact with the person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 can return to work immediately after disinfection is completed."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Who should clean and disinfect community spaces?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Regular cleaning staff can clean and disinfect community spaces. Cleaning staff should be trained on appropriate use of cleaning and disinfection chemicals and provided with the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the chemicals used."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Is cleaning alone effective against the virus that causes COVID-19?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Cleaning does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection. If a surface may have gotten the virus on it from a person with or suspected to have COVID-19, the surface should be cleaned and disinfected. Disinfecting kills germs on surfaces."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What is routine cleaning? How frequently should facilities be cleaned to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "Routine cleaning is the everyday cleaning practices that businesses and communities normally use to maintain a healthy environment. Surfaces frequently touched by multiple people, such as door handles, bathroom surfaces, and handrails, should be cleaned with soap and water or another detergent at least daily when facilities are in use. More frequent cleaning and disinfection may be required based on level of use. For example, certain surfaces and objects in public spaces, such as shopping carts and point of sale keypads, should be cleaned and disinfected before each use. Cleaning <em>removes </em>dirt and impurities, including germs, from surfaces. Cleaning alone does not kill germs, but it reduces the number of germs on a surface."}},{"@type": "Question","name": "Is it safe to vacuum in a school, business, or community facility after someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 has been present?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "</p> <p>The risk of transmitting or spreading SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, during vacuuming is unknown. At this time, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 associated with vacuuming. If vacuuming is necessary or required in a school, business, or community facility that was used by a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, first follow the CDC recommendations for <a href='/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/cleaning-disinfection.html#Cleaning'>Cleaning and Disinfection for Community Facilities</a> that apply, which includes a wait time of 24 hours, or as long as practical.</p> <p>After cleaning and disinfection, the following recommendations may help reduce the risk to workers and other individuals when vacuuming:</p> <ul> <li>Consider removing smaller rugs or carpets from the area completely, so there is less that needs to be vacuumed.</li> <li>Use a vacuum equipped with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, if available.</li> <li>Do not vacuum a room or space that has people in it. Wait until the room or space is empty to vacuum, such as at night, for common spaces, or during the day for private rooms.</li> <li>Consider temporarily turning off room fans and the central HVAC system that services the room or space, so that particles that escape from vacuuming will not circulate throughout the facility.</li> </ul> <p>"}},{"@type": "Question","name": "What is the difference between cleaning and disinfecting?","acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer","text": "<em>Cleaning </em>with soap and water removes germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It lowers the risk of spreading infection. <em>Disinfecting</em> kills germs on surfaces. By killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection."}}					]

                                            <p>Although most COVID-19 cases in children are not severe, serious illness that needs to be treated at the hospital still happens. Some data on children reported that the majority who needed hospitalization for COVID-19 had at least one underlying medical condition. The most common underlying conditions reported among children with COVID-19 include chronic lung disease (including asthma), heart disease, and conditions that weaken the immune system. This information suggests that children with these underlying medical conditions may be at risk for more severe illness from COVID-19.</p>
                                            <p>More data are needed to learn which underlying or complex medical conditions may put children at increased risk. CDC is monitoring new information as it becomes available and will provide updates as needed.</p>

The virus likely spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and other respiratory infections spread. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.&nbsp;This type of spread is not a concern after death.</p>
                                                                                                                                        <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                                                                                                                                        <p>People should consider not touching the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. Older people and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions are at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. There may be less of a chance of the virus spreading from certain types of touching, such as holding the hand or hugging after the body has been prepared for viewing. Other activities, such as kissing, washing, and shrouding should be avoided before, during, and after the body has been prepared, if possible. If washing the body or shrouding are important religious or cultural practices, families are encouraged to work with their community’s cultural and religious leaders and funeral home staff on how to reduce their exposure as much as possible. At a minimum, people conducting these activities should wear disposable gloves. If splashing of fluids is expected, additional personal protective equipment (PPE) may be required (such as disposable gown, faceshield or goggles and N-95 respirator).</p>
